Once a Market has been closed, interest will cease to accrue and no further amendments of the terms of the Loan or borrowing under the Market will be possible. The configuration of a Market may prevent its closure while it is in a Fixed Term State.\n\nf) Termination of Loan\n\nA Loan will terminate upon the earlier of:\n\n(i) the Withdrawal by the Lender of all Equivalent Loaned Assets from the Market;\n\n(ii) the closing of the Market by the Borrower;\n\n(iii) the date notified by the non-defaulting Party to the Defaulting Party as the effective date of termination of the Loan upon the occurrence of an Event of Default as defined in Section 4; provided that the non-defaulting Party shall have the right in its sole discretion to suspend the termination of a Loan under this subsection (iii) and reinstate the Loan.

The Force Buyback permission can be irrevocably removed from a Market by a Borrower at their discretion.\n\nh) Taxes and Fees\n\nNeither the Borrower nor the Lender shall have any liability to the other Party for any taxes due under this Agreement.\n\n3) Representations, Warranties and Covenants\n\nThe Parties hereby make the following representations and warranties, which shall continue during the term of this Agreement and any Loan hereunder:\n\na) Each Party represents and warrants that (i) it has the power to execute and deliver this Agreement, to enter into the Loans contemplated hereby and to perform its obligations hereunder, (ii) it has taken all necessary action to authorise such execution, delivery and performance, and (iii) this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid, and binding obligation enforceable against it in accordance with its terms.\n\nb) Each Party hereto represents and warrants that it has not relied on the other for any tax or accounting advice concerning this Agreement and that it has made its own determination as to the tax and accounting treatment of any Loan, any Asset, or funds received or provided hereunder.\n\nc) Each Party hereto represents and warrants that it is acting for its own account.\n\nd) Each Party hereto represents and warrants that it is a sophisticated party and fully familiar with the inherent risks involved in the transaction contemplated in this Agreement, including, without limitation, risk of new financial regulatory requirements, potential loss of money and risks due to volatility of the price of the Loaned Assets, and voluntarily takes full responsibility for any risk to that effect. \n\ne) Each Party represents and warrants that it is not insolvent and is not subject to any bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings under any Applicable Laws.\n\nf) Each Party represents and warrants there are no proceedings pending or, to its knowledge, threatened, which could reasonably be anticipated to have any adverse effect on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the accuracy of the representations and warranties hereunder or thereunder.\n\ng) The Lender represents and warrants that it has, or will have at the time of the transfer of any Loaned Assets, the right to transfer such Assets, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, and free and clear of all security, liens, charges, mortgages and encumbrances. \n\nh) The Borrower represents and warrants that it has, or will have at the time of the transfer of any Assets (as Equivalent Loaned Assets), the right to transfer such Assets subject to the terms and conditions hereof, and free and clear of all security, liens, charges, mortgages and encumbrances other than those arising under this Agreement.\n\ni) The Borrower represents and warrants that in the event that a Market has been configured so as to have both Force Buyback power and freely transferable Token Transferability, they will not execute the Force Buyback power on any Wallet Address associated with a smart contract that could lead to exogenous losses for any holder of Market Tokens, such as, but not limited to, Uniswap V2 liquidity pools as defined at https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v2/concepts/core-concepts/pools.\n\nj) Each Party represents and warrants that it has all consents of any governmental or other authority that are required to be obtained by it with respect to this Agreement to which it is a Party and will use all reasonable efforts to maintain these in full force and effect, and obtain any that may become necessary in the future.\n\nk) Each Party represents and warrants that it shall provide such information considered reasonably necessary to allow the other Party to conduct appropriate anti-money laundering and know your customer checks as may be required.\n\nl) Each Party represents and warrants that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, no Assets, as Loaned Assets, are, or are related to, the proceeds of criminal activity.\n\nm) Each Party represents and warrants that it has (i) undertaken sufficient due diligence regarding the Chainalysis Sanctions Screening Oracle (the “Oracle”) operation; (ii) understood that a Lender’s Equivalent Loaned Assets may be transferred to a Sanctions Escrow contingent on a Sanctions Event; and (iii) agreed to bear all risks associated with potential Oracle errors or misdesignations, subject to the dispute resolution process outlined in Section 13.\n\nn) Each Party represents and warrants that it has agreed to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Services Agreement.\n\n4) Default\n\nAny of the following events in respect of a Party (the “Defaulting Party”) shall constitute an event of default, and shall be herein referred to as an “Event of Default”: \n\na) the failure of the Borrower to return enough Equivalent Loaned Assets to honour a Lender's Withdrawal request such that the Penalty APR has applied for 90 days;\n\nb) a material default by either Party in the performance of any other provision of this Agreement, and a Party’s failure to cure such material default within ten business days; \n\nc) any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or liquidation proceedings or other proceedings for the relief of debtors or dissolution proceedings that are instituted by or against a Party and are not dismissed within 30 days of the initiation of said proceedings; or\n\nd) any representation or warranty made by either Party in any of the Loan Documents that proves to be incorrect or untrue in any material respect as of the date of making or deemed making thereof; provided that a Party shall have ten business days to cure such Event of Default; provided further that if a Borrower becomes insolvent such that the representation made by the Borrower in Section 3(e) is incorrect or untrue and such insolvency occurs as a result of the Borrower entering into the Loan or otherwise as a result of taking on credit through the Protocol, the Lender may agree that such incorrect or untrue representation shall not constitute an Event of Default under this Section 4(d).\n\n5) Remedies\n\nUpon the occurrence and during the continuation of any Event of Default by the Defaulting Party, the non-defaulting Party may, upon reasonable prior written notice to the Defaulting Party, at its option: (1) terminate this Agreement and any Loan; or (2) exercise all other rights and remedies available to such non-defaulting Party hereunder, under Applicable Law, or in equity.\n\n6) Liability for Attacks on the Protocol\n\nNeither party will be liable for any Loss of Assets arising from any attack on the Protocol, including any such potential attacks as may be detailed in the Risk Disclosure Statement. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Service Provider be liable for any such Loss arising from any attack on the Protocol.\n\n7) Alternative Arrangements in the Event of Loss of Wallet Address Access\n\nIt is possible that either Party may lose access to the Wallet Address through which they have engaged with the Market (a “Loss of Access”), with the result of such Loss of Access being the inability of such Party to engage with the Market to meet its obligations under this Agreement. If a Loss of Access occurs, the Parties agree to engage with each other to implement an alternative method for returning each other to the position they would be in had the Market been terminated by the Borrower at the time such Loss of Access was first communicated to the other Party via a Communication Platform.\n\n8) Transfer of Title\n\nNotwithstanding the use of expressions such as “loan”, which are used to reflect terminology used in the market for transactions of the kind provided for in this Agreement, all right, title and interest in and to the Assets transferred or paid under this Agreement (as Loaned Assets) shall pass to the Borrower upon transfer or payment, the obligation of the Borrower being an obligation to return Equivalent Assets. The Borrower shall be entitled to use the Assets transferred to it in any manner, including transferring such Assets to any account or wallet or for any other purpose.\n\n9) Rights and Remedies Cumulative \n\nNo delay or omission by a Party in exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver of the future exercise of that right or remedy or of any other rights or remedies hereunder, provided that upon the occurrence of an Event of Default such default shall be deemed waived if a Party does not begin exercising remedies with respect to such Event of Default within 30 days of notice of its occurrence. All rights of each Party stated herein are cumulative and in addition to all other rights provided by law, in equity. \n\n10) Survival of Rights and Remedies\n\nAll remedies hereunder and all obligations with respect to any Loan shall survive the termination of the relevant Loan, return of Loaned Assets, and termination of this Agreement. \n\n11) Governing Law; Dispute Resolution\n\nThis Agreement (including any non-contractual obligations or liabilities arising out of it or in connection with it) is governed by and is to be construed in accordance with the laws of the Cayman Islands.\n\n12) Third Party Beneficiaries\n\na) Per the implementation of the Protocol, the Market Tokens associated with a given Loan, which must be transferred back to the Market by a Lender in order to effect a Withdrawal, can be transferred by the Lender to any Wallet Address that is permitted by the Token Transferability level of the Market, which, for the avoidance of doubt, need not be a Specified Wallet Address.\n\nb) This Agreement is enforceable in its entirety by any third party (a “Third Party Beneficiary”) which has ownership over a Wallet Address holding Market Tokens; provided that such Third Party Beneficiary successfully completes any Lender Check Processes as may be specified via Role Providers by the Borrower. For the avoidance of doubt, any Known Lender in possession of Market Tokens is capable of enforcing this Agreement in its entirety.\n\nc) If a Third Party Beneficiary cannot clear or will not engage with such Lender Check Processes, such Third Party Beneficiary shall not be entitled to enforce any rights under this Agreement and may be prevented from initiating Withdrawals in accordance with the specific rules of the Market.\n\nd) If a Third Party Beneficiary possesses Market Tokens that have been acquired through any event as contemplated as being within the scope of Section 6, this Section 12 shall not apply to such Third Party Beneficiary and such Third Party Beneficiary shall have no right to enforce the terms of this Agreement.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, Third Party Beneficiary possessing such Market Tokens need not have acquired said Market Tokens directly from a Lender in order for this Section 12 to apply.\n\n13) Treatment of Sanctioned Entities\n\na) All Markets deployed via the Protocol are monitored by a Chainalysis Sanctions Screening Oracle (the “Oracle”) via the Sentinel to determine whether Wallet Addresses are present on various sanctions designations such as those maintained by the US, EU and UN.\n\nb) The Parties agree that the Oracle shall serve as the definitive source for determining whether any Wallet Address associated with a Party is subject to sanctions.\n\nc) In the event that either the Borrower Wallet Address or a Lender Wallet Address that holds Market Tokens is subject to a Sanctions Event, this Agreement between the Parties shall immediately and automatically be suspended.\n\nd) In the event that a Lender Wallet Address is sanctioned, the Sentinel will perform the following actions following the earlier of (i) the Lender attempting to make a Withdrawal, or (ii) the Borrower or any other third party triggering a removal function within the Market:\n\n* A Sanctions Escrow smart contract will be created.\n\n* The sanctioned Lender will be forced into an immediate Withdrawal request for the balance of their Market Tokens, and\n\n* The Equivalent Loaned Assets will not be returned to the Lender, but rather transferred to the Sanctions Escrow, whereupon they can be reclaimed by the Lender either (x) when the Lender Wallet Address is no longer subject to a Sanctions Event, or (y) if the Borrower explicitly overrides the sanction via the Market, which they may do if they determine the Oracle designation was erroneous.\n\ne) In the event that a Lender disputes a Sanctions Event:\n\nThe burden of proof shall rest solely with the Lender to demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that the Oracle's designation was erroneous;\n\nThe Lender must provide substantial evidence of their non-sanctioned status, which may include, but is not limited to:\n\n* Documentation demonstrating ownership and control of the relevant Wallet Addresses;\n\n* Evidence of the true beneficial owner of the Wallet Addresses in question; and\n\n* Evidence showing the Oracle's designation conflicts with verifiable sanctions data.\n\nUntil such time as either (x) the Oracle removes the sanctions designation or (y) the Borrower explicitly overrides the sanction via the Market, all provisions in this Section 13 shall remain in full force and effect.\n\n14) Third Party Rights \n\nNo term of this Agreement is enforceable by a person who is not a Party to this Agreement. The rights of the Parties to rescind or vary this Agreement are not subject to the consent of any other person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a person who is not a party to this Agreement but who is a Third Party Beneficiary may, in their own right, enforce their rights under this Agreement.\n\n15) Notices\n\nUnless otherwise provided in this Agreement, all notices or demands relating to this Agreement shall be sent by a Communication Platform to the respective Party, as specified through the Website. \n\n16) Variation, Assignment, Successors and Assigns\n\na) No variation of this Agreement shall be valid unless it is in writing and signed by or on behalf of each of the Parties.\n\nb) This Agreement is binding on and inures to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors, heirs, personal representatives, and permitted assigns.\n\nc) No Party may assign or delegate its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other Party.\n\n17) Single Agreement\n\nThe Borrower and the Lender acknowledge that, and have entered into this Agreement in reliance on the fact that, all Loans hereunder constitute a single business and contractual relationship and have been entered into in consideration of each other. Accordingly, the Borrower and the Lender hereby agree that payments, deliveries, and other transfers made by either of them in respect of any Loan shall be deemed to have been made in consideration of payments, deliveries, and other transfers in respect of any other Loan hereunder, and the obligations to make any such payments, deliveries and other transfers may be applied against each other and netted. In addition, the Borrower and the Lender acknowledge that, and have entered into this Agreement in reliance on the fact that, all Loans hereunder have been entered into in consideration of each other. \n\n18) Entire Agreement\n\nThis Agreement and the Term Sheet constitutes the entire Agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede any prior negotiations, understandings and agreements with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. Nothing in this Section 18 shall be construed to conflict with or negate Section 17 above.\n\n19) Partial Invalidity\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is or becomes or is found by a court or other competent authority to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect, in whole or in part, under any law of any jurisdiction, neither the legality, validity and enforceability in that jurisdiction of any other provision or part of this Agreement, nor the legality, validity or enforceability in any other jurisdiction of that provision or part or of any other provision of this Agreement, shall be affected or impaired.\n\n20) Intention to be Bound\n\nBy clicking on the “Sign” (or similar) button, the Borrower and the Lender intend to be legally bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. \n\n21) No Relationship\n\nThis Agreement does not create any kind of partnership, joint venture, fiduciary, agency or trustee relationship or any similar relationship or legal arrangement between the Parties or between either Party and any other person.\n\n22) No Waiver\n\nSave as otherwise agreed, the failure of or delay by either Party to enforce an obligation or exercise a right or remedy under any provision of this Agreement or to exercise any election in this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of such provision, and any such delay or failure to enforce, the waiver of, a particular obligation in one circumstance will not prevent such Party from subsequently requiring compliance with the obligation or exercising the right or remedy in the future. No waiver or modification by either Party of any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been made unless expressed in writing and signed by both parties.\n\n23) Termination of Agreement\n\nIn the event of a termination of this Agreement, any Loaned Assets shall be redelivered immediately, unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties, and any fees owed shall be payable immediately.  \n\n24) Miscellaneous\n\nWhenever used herein, the singular number shall include the plural, the plural the singular, and the use of the masculine, feminine, or neuter gender shall include all genders where necessary and appropriate.
